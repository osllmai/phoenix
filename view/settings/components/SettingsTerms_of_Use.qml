2. Risk Control Violations: If the assessment confirms that the account has been banned due to triggering risk control mechanisms, we will be unable to restore your access privileges, and no refund will be provided.

suspending or terminating the relevant accounts, canceling all illegally
obtained benefits, and reserving the right to pursue legal liability.

To more effectively identify and prevent abnormal behavior, we have
further upgraded OS LLM ai's account security risk control system
while ensuring that the rights of normal users are not affected. We
understand that misjudgments may occur during the implementation
process, so we provide a dedicated appeal channel. If you believe your

provision of high-quality services. We appreciate every user who abides
by the rules; your support enables our platform to thrive healthily.

# Severability and Waiver:

## Severability:

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be modified and interpreted to accomplish its objectives to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

## Waiver:

Except as explicitly stated herein, the failure to exercise a right or enforce an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or enforce such obligation at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

## Translation Interpretation:

These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if made available to you in another language on our Service. In the event of a dispute, the original English version shall prevail.

## Changes to These Terms and Conditions:

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice before the new terms take effect. The determination of what constitutes a material change will be made at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after the revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, either in whole or in part, you must stop using the Service and website.
