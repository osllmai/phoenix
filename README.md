### 🔥 About Phoenix
Phoenix is an **open-source application** built with **Qt/QML** that enables seamless interaction with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** locally, without requiring an internet connection.  

The platform is designed to **automatically detect** whether your system has a GPU and load models accordingly, allowing you to use them as powerful AI assistants directly on your machine.

---

### 🚀 Features
- ✅ Support for both **local** and **online models**, as well as all models available on **Hugging Face**.  
- 🎤 Integrated **speech-to-text** functionality using local models, enabling **real-time voice recording and transcription**.  
- 🔌 Flexible integration through **API** or **socket connections**, so that other applications on your system can access and use the locally loaded models.  
- ⚙️ Full customization of **model configurations**, giving users control to adapt performance and resources to their specific needs.  
- 🖥️ A clean and **user-friendly UI** that simplifies interaction with models and settings.
